# 3D Cube Spinner

A simple 3D flat-shaded cube rendered in 2D using basic vector math and [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).  
A fixed light source is shown on screen as a yellow dot, and the cube is shaded based on the angle of its faces relative to the light.

## 📝 About

This project was built as a self-learning exercise to explore 3D graphics principles from scratch.  
It includes custom code for matrix multiplication to handle 3D rotations and perspective projection.

No external 3D libraries or AI assistance were used — everything was coded manually to better understand the underlying mathematics.

## 🎮 Controls

- **Arrow keys** — Rotate the cube  
- **W / A / S / D** — Move the cube position on screen  
- **X / Z** — Increase / decrease the field of view (FOV)

---

## 💻 Running the Project

- Open `main.py` in [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)  
- Click **Run ▶** to start the program  
- ✅ Uses only Python’s standard library (`tkinter`, `math`) — no external installations needed

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter (for rendering)
- Math (for 3D vector and matrix calculations)

---

## 📌 Notes

- Renders a flat-shaded 3D cube without using any dedicated 3D engine  
- Shows a fixed-position yellow dot indicating the light source  
- Written as a personal learning project
